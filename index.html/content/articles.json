            "content": "<h2>Understanding Stroke Rehabilitation</h2><p>Stroke is one of the leading causes of long-term disability worldwide. When a stroke occurs, it disrupts blood flow to the brain, potentially causing damage that affects movement, speech, cognition, and daily functioning. Physiotherapy is a cornerstone of stroke rehabilitation, helping patients recover lost abilities and adapt to any permanent changes.</p><h2>Early Intervention Matters</h2><p>Research consistently shows that early physiotherapy intervention leads to better outcomes. In the acute phase (first few days after stroke), physiotherapists focus on:</p><ul><li>Preventing complications like pneumonia and blood clots</li><li>Proper positioning to prevent contractures</li><li>Early mobilization when medically stable</li><li>Assessment of functional abilities</li></ul><h2>Key Physiotherapy Techniques</h2><p>Modern stroke rehabilitation employs evidence-based techniques including:</p><ul><li><strong>Task-specific training:</strong> Practicing real-world activities</li><li><strong>Strength training:</strong> Rebuilding muscle power</li><li><strong>Balance exercises:</strong> Improving stability and preventing falls</li><li><strong>Gait training:</strong> Relearning to walk safely</li><li><strong>Constraint-induced movement therapy:</strong> Encouraging use of affected limbs</li></ul><h2>The Recovery Journey</h2><p>Recovery from stroke is highly individual. While some patients make rapid progress, others require months or years of dedicated therapy. The brain's neuroplasticity—its ability to form new neural connections—means that improvement can continue long after the initial stroke.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Physiotherapy provides hope and practical solutions for stroke survivors. Through consistent, evidence-based treatment, many patients achieve significant improvements in their mobility and independence.</p>"
